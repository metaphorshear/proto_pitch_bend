# proto_pitch_bend
This was a little project that started when I wanted to build a whammy pedal.  Before ordering a microcontroller, it seemed wiser to get the proof of concept working in Python.  So that's what I did.  It's still a work in progress, and it isn't designed to be maintainable so much as quick to experiment with (because I don't quite know what I'm doing.)
